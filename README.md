ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zuhayer Alvi 
As a computer science student with a passion for web development, I am constantly seeking new ways to create engaging and user-friendly online experiences. I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science at The City College of New York, where I am gaining expertise in web development technologies such as JavaScript and other frameworks as well as learning Backend as well. I am eager to continue learning and growing as a web developer, and am excited to see where a career in this field will take me.
